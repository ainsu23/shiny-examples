### Lack of articles
Polish does not have definite articles: **a, an, the**. Hence *dziewczyna* (girl)
may be interpreted as "a girl" or "the girl".

### Noun gender
There are 3 gender: *masculine, feminine and neuter*. It's very similar to spanish,
depends on the endings. *dobra szkola* (bonita escuela); *dobry nauczyciel* (buen
profesor). For animals depends on the sex of the animal.

### Plural

 - dom -> domy
 - córka -> córki
 - kompute -> komputery
 But exceptions:
 - Polak -> Polacy

Nouns neuter in gender usually the ending in -a:
 - piwo -> piwa
 - morze -> morza
 - mydlo -> mydla (soap -> soaps)
