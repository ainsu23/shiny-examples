# Chapter 4: Case study: ER injuries

This chapter has a case of study where all learned is used. Additional,
introduces functions outside the ui and server.

## What I learned?
- Extract data from a vector going forward and backward using two actionButtons.
- Shiny is lazy, for that *ObserveEvents* are very important to update
**reactiveValues**. The difference between observeEvent and eventReactive is 
that the first one is not assign to a variable and the second one it is assigned.
