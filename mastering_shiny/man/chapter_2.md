# chapter 2: Basic UI

It shows some ui options to display in an app.

## What I learned?

- According to the design of the app and what is wanted to show, exist an ui
function and its server function. Some examples are:

**ui**
selectizeInput, TextInput, sliderInput,
plotOutput, verbatimTextOutput, textOuput, DT::dataTableOutput

**server**
renderPlot, renderPrint, renderText, DT::renderDataTable
